    		<h3>Course Overview</h3>
            <p>In this course, we would be able to learn various front-end technologies such as PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript. Along with different techniques and advantages of writing code effectively and effiently to tackle attacks.</p>
    		<h3>Lab 1</h3>
            <p>Part 1 involves using Wireshark to understand how websites communicate, exploring HTTP through direct messages with servers via Telnet. In Part 2, we build websites using CGI to connect user input to C programs and delve into PHP for website development. We also cover the secure handling of information online.</p>
    		<h3>Lab 2</h3>
            <p>Task 1 includes creating an HTML file with tags, a headshot image, and a form. JavaScript tasks involve coding for displaying the current date/time, creating a digital clock, implementing show/hide functionality for an email, and displaying an analog clock. Task 2 explores advanced topics like Ajax, CSS, jQuery, and Web API integration. It covers Ajax GET requests, CSS styling, jQuery library usage for Ajax requests and responses, and Web API integration to fetch and display programming jokes. The lab emphasizes practical application, from basic HTML to advanced concepts.</p>
            <h3>Hackathon 1</h3>
            <p>In the hackathon activity, we will explore the world of reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, gaining practical insights into web application vulnerabilities. The challenge consists of seven levels, each requiring the injection of code to display my name using the alert() function. With increasing difficulty from Level 0 to Level 6 and corresponding point assignments, this activity promises a dynamic learning curve. Success involves not only showcasing proficiency in executing XSS attacks but also analyzing and deciphering the source code of the web application, enhancing understanding of crucial web security principles. This hands-on exploration contributes significantly to expertise in ethical hacking, security assessment, and responsible disclosure practices.</p>
            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>In Project 1, we would deploy our professional website on Github in a form of Resume by using various front end technologies as well as technical and non-technical requirements.</p>
